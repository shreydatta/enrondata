# Identify Fraud from Enron Data
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

Aim of this project is to build a fraud identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. Along with this we have got data about handful of fraudsters who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
